# BlogNest

**BlogNest** is a modular full-stack web application developed using the Flask framework. This project is a blog application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts. The backend is built following RESTful API principles, while the frontend uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

### Backend:
- Python
- Flask
- SQLAlchemy
- SQLite
- Flask-Mail
- Flask-RESTx
- Flask-JWT-Extended

### Frontend:
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS

## About the Project

The main objective of **BlogNest** is to create a modern backend API that securely handles user authentication and authorization for a blog platform. Key features of the project include:

- Flask factory pattern is used for application instance creation.
- Modular structure for easy scalability and maintainability.
- ORM (Object Relational Mapping) is used with SQLAlchemy for database interactions.
- DTO (Data Transfer Object) pattern is used to transfer data between frontend and backend.
- Business logic is separated using services, ensuring a clean architecture.
- An API layer handles requests and responses efficiently.
- Custom exception handlers manage errors and exceptions gracefully.
- User authentication and authorization are managed using JWT tokens.
- Custom decorators enhance user authentication and authorization handling.

## Features

- User registration and login
- JWT-based user authentication and authorization
- Blog post CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
- Comment CRUD operations on blog posts
- Favoriting blog posts and viewing favorites
- Liking blog posts and tracking total likes
